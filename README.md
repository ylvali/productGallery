# productGallery

A gallery presenting one image at a time, clickable miniatures and has lightbox mode.
You need to write the css base yourself, but the functionality is all done.

Easy to use, just beware of the identifying tags and their connections.
Three separate jQuery plugins to be used as one product gallery but can also be used seperately. 

The functionality is clickable miniatures, displayed image texts, button for an image slideshow and the main image can be clicked to see it in lightbox mode. An array of images needs to be inserted in the js-file , make sure paths are correct.
Theese are the images that will be handled in the function - to make miniatures that you can click, to see a larger version with the backgound faded away ('lightbox') and for the slideshow.
The lightbox fires off on a specific image tag, so you need to make sure that tag as an image.

Enjoy :)
