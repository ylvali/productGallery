# productGallery

A gallery presenting one image at a time, clickable miniatures and has lightbox mode.

Easy to use, just beware of the identifying tags and their connections.
Three separate jQuery plugins to be used as one product gallery but can also be used seperately. 

The functionality is clickable miniatures, displayed image texts, button for an image slideshow and the main image can be clicked to see it in lightbox mode. An array of images needs to be inserted in the js-file that exist in your work environment, make sure path is correct.
Theese are the images that will be handled in the function for miniatures you can click to see a larger version and for the slideshow.
The lightbox fires off on a specific image tag, so you need to make sure it is correct.

Enjoy :)
